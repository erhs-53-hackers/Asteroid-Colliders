<h3>Welcome to Asteroid Colliders</h3>

<p>
Asteroid Colliders was a project started by the programming team of the 
robotics club at Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, Maryland.  
The game was started as a simple project by one of the members of the team, 
and was later expanded to encompass and teach others basic OOP skills.
